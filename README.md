# Doomrecey
<h3>Do more C++ & C.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I haven't played with it in a long while.</li>
  <li>Compiling with G++ and GCC.</li>
  <li>Has a small Python script for some simple help.</li>
  <li>Potential unstructured code for practising purposes.</li>
  <li>Using CMake (like a noob) for building the project.</li>
</ul>

Note #1: Simple compiling reminders.

```
gcc ${array_of_files (.c)} -o doomrecey
```
```
g++ ${array_of_files (.cpp)} -o doomrecey++ (with -std=c++11)
```

Note #2: CMakeLists.txt is added for C and C++ binaries.

Note #3: In the future i'd want to try embedded development with these tools as well (embedded C/C++).
